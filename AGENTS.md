# Instructions for AI Agents

-   Read the entire `README.md` file before starting development. It contains instructions on installing, building, and testing the project.
-   The project is intended to be a simple, static HTML + CSS + vanilla Javascript website, with no 3rd-party dependencies or packages in the final deployed website.
-   The `docs` folder is NOT for documentation, but actually contains the final HTML build output of the Python site generator (it's called "docs" because GitHub Pages, where I host the production site, required that as the deployment folder name at the time I created this project). All of the HTML files in this folder are generated by the Python scripts, and should not be edited directly - they should only be used for checking what the final output site looks like.
-   The only non-generated file in the `docs` folder is `diff_highlight.js`, which can be edited directly, and changes to it will persist after a build.
-   Before committing ANY changes, first build the site, then run the frontend tests. The build script must run without error and all the tests must pass before committing.
-   When running the build step, it will print out the parsed text, as well as the index of each page that it generates. This can be a lot of text, but doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong or broken.

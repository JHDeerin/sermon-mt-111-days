        <h1>Sermon on the Mount ðŸŒ„<br>In 111 Days</h1>

        <p>The Sermon on the Mount is the longest recorded speech of Jesus Christ in the Bible, preserved in 111 verses in Matthew 5-7. It is one of the most well-known passages in scripture, the source of many phrases that have entered our everyday language - "blessed are the meek", "the salt of the earth", "a city on a hill", "turn the other cheek", "love your enemies", "no one can serve two masters", "seek and you will find", "whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them." For the Christian, it is a timeless source of moral wisdom, a call to "seek first the kingdom of God," and a constant reminder of how much we need God's grace as we compare our lives to the lofty principles of God.</p>
        <p>This site was created to help with memorizing the whole Sermon, one verse at a time, by memorizing one new verse each day. Everyone learns differently; a different way might work best for you. But for those who are interested in memorizing the whole Sermon, I hope and pray you find this a helpful resource.</p>

            <summary><b>How I use these pages</b></summary>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the page for today - read the section title, the section's verse references, and the verse references for the chunk you're memorizing today.</li>
                <li>Reveal and read the chunk of scripture for today, paying special attention to today's new verse. Repeat the new verse aloud until you think you've "got it."</li>
                <li>Hide the text again, and in the "Practice" box type out the entire chunk of scripture - as much as you remember (don't worry about spacing or punctuation, which won't be checked, but do worry about spelling). When you think you're done, or have gotten as far as you can, hit the "Check My Answer" button.</li>
                <li>If you got the answer word-perfect, great! If you got some things wrong, try to correct them at first without looking at the passage again. If you still don't get it right, re-reveal the text, check the passage, correct your practice text, and check your answer until you get it right.</li>
                <li>Reveal the "Meditation" for the day and read it. Take some time to reflect on it, while thinking of the passage text as you go.</li>
                <li>Later in the day (preferably at least an hour later), come back to the page and go to the "Whole Sermon So Far" section. Try typing in <em>all</em> the verses you've seen before this point (without looking at the text if possible). Check your answer. Repeat step 4, if necessary, until you get the whole thing right.</li>

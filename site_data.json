In their character there is a preserving force to keep the rest of society from utter corruption.\nIf they were not scattered among men, the race would putrefy. But if they are Christians only in name, and the real power is gone, nothing can save them, and they are of no use whatever to those among whom they mingle.\nThere is a secret something, which is the secret of the believer's power: that something is savor: it is not easy to define it, but yet it is absolutely essential to usefulness. A worldling may be of some use even if he fails in certain respects; but a Christian who is not a Christian is bad all round, he is \"good for nothing\", and utterly useless to anybody and everybody. Utter rejection awaits him: He will \"be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.\" His religion makes a footpath for fashion, or for scorn, as the world may happen to take it: in either case it is no preservative, for it does not even preserve itself from contempt.\nHow this teaches the necessity of final perseverance! for if the savor of divine grace could be altogether gone from a man it could never be restored: the text is very clear and positive upon that point. What unscriptural nonsense to tall; of a man's being born again, and yet losing the divine life, and then getting it again. Regeneration cannot fail: if it did, the man must be for ever hopeless. He could not be born again, and again, and again: his case would be beyond the reach of mercy. :But who is hopeless? Are there any whom it is impossible to restore? If so, some may have altogether fallen from grace, but not else. Those who speak of all men as within the reach of grace may not scripturally or logically believe in total apostasy, since \"it is impossible to restore them unto repentance\", if any have really apostatized.\nThe great lesson is, that if grace itself fails to save a man, nothing else can be done for him. \"If the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?\" You can salt meat, but you cannot salt salt: if grace fails everything fails. Gracious Master, do not permit me to try any experiments as to how far I may lose my savor; but ever keep me full of grace and truth.",

Such anger without cause brings us under higher judgment than that of Jewish police-courts. God takes cognizance of the emotions from which acts of hate may spring, and calls us to account as much for the angry feeling as for the murderous deed.\nWords also come under the same condemnation: a man shall be judged for what he \"shall say to his brother.\" To call a man Raca, or a worthless fellow, is to kill him in his reputation; and to say to him, \"Thou fool\", is to kill him as to the noblest characteristics of a man. Hence all this comes under such censure as men distribute in their councils; yea, under what is far worse, the punishment awarded by the highest court of the universe, which dooms men to \"hell fire .\" Thus our Lord and King restores the law of God to its true force, and warns us that it denounces not only the overt act of killing, but every thought, feeling, and word which would tend to injure a brother, or annihilate him by contempt.\nWhat a sweeping law is this! My conscience might have been easy as to the command \"Thou shalt not kill;\" but if anger without just cause be murder, how shall I answer for it? \"Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation!\"",

They are to be as the anvil when bad men are the hammers, and thus they are to overcome by patient forgiveness. The rule of the judgment-seat is not for common life; but the rule of the cross and the all-enduring Sufferer is for us all. Yet how many regard all this as fanatical, utopian, and even cowardly. The Lord, our King, would have us bear and forbear, and conquer by mighty patience. Can we do it? How are we the servants of Christ if we have not his spirit?",

The courts Of our Lord's day were vicious; and his disciples were advised to suffer wrong sooner than appeal to them. Our own courts often furnish the surest method of solving a difficulty by authority, and we have known them resorted to with the view of preventing strife. Yet even in a country where justice can be had, we are not to resort to law for every personal wrong. We should rather endure to be put upon than be for ever crying out, \"I'll bring an action.\"\nAt times this very rule of self-sacrifice may require us to take steps in the way of legal appeal, to stop injuries which would fall heavily upon others; but we ought often to forego our own advantage, yea, always when the main motive would be a proud desire for self-vindication.\nLord, give me a patient spirit, so that I may not seek to avenge myself, oven when I might righteously do so!",

This is a sad crime against the Word of the Lord. The Holy Spirit will only father his own words. He owns the precept, \"Thou shall love thy neighbor\", but he hates the parasitical growth of \"hate thine enemy.\" This last sentence is destructive of that out of which it appears legitimately to grow; since those who are here styled enemies are, in fact, neighbors.

A man's character may be perfect, and entire, wanting nothing; and yet such a man will be the very first to admit that the grace which is in him is at best in its infancy, and though perfect as a child in all its parts, it has not yet attained to the perfection of full-grown manhood.\nWhat a mark is set before us by our Perfect King, who, speaking from his mountain-throne, saith, \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\"!

Let proud men boast as they please, those who are in Christ's kingdom will always pray, \"Forgive us our debts .\" Our Lord knew that we should always have debts to own, and therefore would always need to cry, \"Forgive!\"This is the prayer of men whom the Judge has absolved because of their faith in the Great Sacrifice; for now to their Father they come for free forgiveness, as children. No man may pass a day without praying \"Forgive\"; and in his supplication he should not forget his fellow-sinners, but should pray\"Forgive us.\" The writer ventures to pray, \"Lord, forgive me, and my brother over yonder, who says he is perfect.\"\nThis pardon we can only obtain as we freely pass over the offenses of others against ourselves: \"as we forgive our debtors.\" This is a reasonable, nay, a blessed requirement, which it is a delight to fulfill. It would not be safe for God to forgive a man who will not forgive others.\nLord, I most heartily forgive all who may have done me wrong, I am lenient with those who are indebted to me; and now, with a hopeful heart, I pray thee forgive me, as surer, as I now forgive all who are in and sense my debtors.",

As I would not run into temptation of myself, I pray thee, do not lead me where I must inevitably meet it.\nBut if I must be tried, Lord, deliver me from falling into evil, and specially preserve me from that evil one, who, above all, seeks my soul, to destroy it. Temptation or trial may be for my good, if I am delivered from evil.\nLord, do this for me, for I cannot preserve myself.\nThe prayer finishes with a doxology. That devotion which begins with prayer ends in praise. All rule, and might and honor, belong to God; and to him let them for ever be ascribed. His is \"the kingdom\", or the right to rule; \"the power\", or the might to uphold his authority; and \"the glory\", or the honor that comes out of his government. Our whole heart delights that the Lord is thus supreme and glorious; and therefore we say,\"Amen.\" How perfect is this model of prayer! So fit for man to pray, so suitable to be laid before the throng of the Majesty on High. Oh, that we may have grace to copy it all our days! Jesus, our King, will not refuse to present a prayer which is of his own drawing up and is directed to the Father whom he loves to glorify.",

Hypocrites went about with faces unwashed, and dolorous, that all might say, \"See how rigidly those men are fasting. What good men the, must be!\" To look miserable in order to be thought holy- is a wretched piece of hypocrisy; and as it makes fasting into a trick to catch human admiration, it thereby destroys it as a means of grace.

We may own our obligations to Jesus, and so call him \"Lord, Lord\"; but if we never practically carry out those obligations, what is the value of our admissions? Our King receives not into his kingdom those whose religion lies in words and ceremonies; but only those whose lives display the obedience of true discipleship.",

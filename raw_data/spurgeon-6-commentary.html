<p class="author">MATTHEW 6:1-18 THE KING CONTRASTS THE LAWS OF HIS KINGDOM WITH THE CONDUCT OF OUTWARD RELIGIONISTS IN THE MATTERS OF ALMS AND PRAYER</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:1" name="6:1"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.1;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.1" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:1</a>.&nbsp;TAKE heed that ye do not your&nbsp;alms&nbsp;before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye&nbsp;hate&nbsp;no&nbsp;reward&nbsp;of your&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which is in&nbsp;heaven.</p>
<p>Our King sets men right as to Almsgiving. It is taken for granted that we give to the&nbsp;poor. How could we be in Christ’s&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;if we did not?</p>
<p>Alms&nbsp;may be given publicly, but not for the sake of publicity. It is important that we have a right aim; for if we obtain the result of a wrong aim, our success will be a failure. If we give to be seen, we shall be seen, and there will be an end of it: “Ye have no&nbsp;reward&nbsp;of your&nbsp;father&nbsp;which is in&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;”:&nbsp;we lose the only&nbsp;reward&nbsp;worth having. But if we give to please our&nbsp;Father, we shall find our&nbsp;reward&nbsp;at his&nbsp;hands. To the matter of our intent and design we must “take heed&nbsp;”;&nbsp;for nobody goes right without carefully aiming to do so. Our giving of&nbsp;alms&nbsp;should be a holy&nbsp;duty, carefully performed, not for our own&nbsp;honor, but for God’s&nbsp;pleasure. Let each reader ask himself, how much he has done, in the way the King prescribes.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:2" name="6:2"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.2;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.2" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:2</a>.&nbsp;Therefore when thou doest thine&nbsp;alms, do not sound a&nbsp;trumpet&nbsp;before thee, as the&nbsp;hypocrites&nbsp;do in the synagogues and in the&nbsp;streets. that they may have&nbsp;glory&nbsp;of men. Verily I say unto, They have their&nbsp;reward.</p>
<p>We must not copy the loud&nbsp;charity&nbsp;of certain vainglorious persons: their character is hypocritical, their manner is ostentatious, their aim is to be seen of men, their&nbsp;reward&nbsp;is in the present. That&nbsp;reward&nbsp;is a very&nbsp;poor&nbsp;one, and is soon over. To stand with a&nbsp;penny&nbsp;in one&nbsp;hand&nbsp;and a&nbsp;trumpet&nbsp;in the other is the posture of&nbsp;hypocrisy. “Glory&nbsp;of men&nbsp;” is a thing which can be&nbsp;bought: but&nbsp;honor&nbsp;from&nbsp;God&nbsp;is a very different thing. This is an advertising age, and too many are saying, “Behold my liberality!” Those who have&nbsp;Jesus&nbsp;for their King must wear his livery of&nbsp;humility, and not the&nbsp;scarlet&nbsp;trappings of a purse-proud&nbsp;generosity, which blows its own&nbsp;trumpet, not only in the&nbsp;streets, but even in the synagogues. We cannot expect two&nbsp;rewards&nbsp;for the same action: if we have it now we shall not have it hereafter. Unrewarded&nbsp;alms&nbsp;will alone&nbsp;count&nbsp;in the&nbsp;record&nbsp;of the last day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:3" name="6:3"></a><a id="6:4" name="6:4"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.3;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.3" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:3</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%206.4;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 6.4" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a>.&nbsp;But when thou doest&nbsp;alms, let not thy left&nbsp;hand&nbsp;know what thy right&nbsp;hand&nbsp;doeth: that thine&nbsp;alms&nbsp;may be in&nbsp;secret: and thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which seeth in&nbsp;secret&nbsp;himself shall&nbsp;reward&nbsp;thee openly.</p>
<p>Seek&nbsp;secrecy for your good&nbsp;deeds. Do not even see your own&nbsp;virtue.&nbsp;Hide&nbsp;from yourself that which you yourself have done that is commendable; for the&nbsp;proud&nbsp;contemplation of your own&nbsp;generosity&nbsp;may tarnish all your&nbsp;alms.</p>
<p>Keep the thing so&nbsp;secret&nbsp;that even you yourself are hardly aware that you are doing anything at all praiseworthy. Let&nbsp;God&nbsp;be present, and you will have enough of an audience. He will&nbsp;reward&nbsp;you,&nbsp;reward&nbsp;you&nbsp;“openly&nbsp;”,&nbsp;reward&nbsp;you as a&nbsp;Father&nbsp;rewards&nbsp;a&nbsp;child,&nbsp;reward&nbsp;you as one who saw what you did and knew that you did it wholly unto him.</p>
<p>Lord, help me, when I am doing good, to keep my left&nbsp;hand&nbsp;out of it, that I may have no sinister motive, and no desire to have a present&nbsp;reward&nbsp;of&nbsp;praise&nbsp;among my fellow-men.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:5" name="6:5"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.5;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.5" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:5</a>.&nbsp;And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the&nbsp;hypocrites&nbsp;are: for they&nbsp;love&nbsp;to&nbsp;pray&nbsp;standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the&nbsp;streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their&nbsp;reward.</p>
<p>Prayer also is taken for granted. No man can be in the&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;of&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;who does not&nbsp;pray.</p>
<p>Those around our&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;knew what he meant when he alluded to the&nbsp;hypocrites;&nbsp;for they had often Been the&nbsp;proud&nbsp;sectary standing in&nbsp;public&nbsp;places repeating his prayers, and very likely they had hitherto felt bound to hold such in repute for superior sanctity. By our Lord’s words these&nbsp;hypocrites&nbsp;are unmasked, and made to seem what they really are. Our King was wonderfully plain-spoken, and called both things and persons by their right names. These religionists were not seekers of&nbsp;God, but seekers after popularity; men who twisted even&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;into a means for self aggrandizement. They chose places and times which would render their saying of prayers conspicuous.&nbsp;The synagogues and the corners of the&nbsp;streets&nbsp;suited them admirably; for their aim was “that they may be seen of&nbsp;men.&nbsp;” They were seen. They had what they sought for. This was their&nbsp;reward, and the whole of it.</p>
<p>Lord, let me never be so&nbsp;profane&nbsp;as to&nbsp;pray&nbsp;to thee with the intent of getting&nbsp;praise&nbsp;for myself.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:6" name="6:6"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.6;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.6" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:6</a>.&nbsp;But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy&nbsp;door,&nbsp;pray&nbsp;to thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which is in&nbsp;secret; and thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which seeth in&nbsp;secret&nbsp;shall&nbsp;reward&nbsp;thee openly.</p>
<p>Be alone; enter into a little&nbsp;room&nbsp;into which no other may intrude; keep out every interloper by shutting the&nbsp;door; and there, and then, with all thy&nbsp;heart&nbsp;pour out thy&nbsp;supplication. “Pray&nbsp;to thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;”:&nbsp;prayer is mainly to be addressed to&nbsp;God&nbsp;the&nbsp;Father; and always to&nbsp;God&nbsp;as our :Father.&nbsp;Pray&nbsp;to thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;who is there present, to thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;who sees thee, and specially takes note of that which is evidently meant for him only, seeing it is done “in&nbsp;secret&nbsp;”,&nbsp;where no&nbsp;eye&nbsp;can see but his own. If it be indeed to&nbsp;God&nbsp;that we&nbsp;pray, there can be no need for anyone else to be present; for it would&nbsp;hinder&nbsp;rather than help&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;to have a third person for witness of the heart’s private intercourse with the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p>As the very&nbsp;soul&nbsp;of prayer&nbsp;lies&nbsp;in&nbsp;communion&nbsp;with&nbsp;God, we shall&nbsp;pray&nbsp;best&nbsp;when all our attention is confined to him; and we shall&nbsp;best&nbsp;reach our end of being accepted by him when we have no regard to the opinion of anyone else.&nbsp;Secret&nbsp;prayer is truly heard and&nbsp;openly&nbsp;answered in the Lord’s own way and time. Our King&nbsp;reigns&nbsp;“in&nbsp;secret&nbsp;”:&nbsp;there he sets up his&nbsp;court, and there will he welcome our approaches. We are not where&nbsp;God&nbsp;sees when we&nbsp;court&nbsp;publicity, and&nbsp;pray&nbsp;to obtain credit for our&nbsp;devotion.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:7" name="6:7"></a><a id="6:8" name="6:8"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.7;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.7" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:7</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%206.8;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 6.8" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a>.&nbsp;But when ye&nbsp;pray, use not&nbsp;vain&nbsp;repetitions, as the&nbsp;heathen&nbsp;do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your&nbsp;Father&nbsp;knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
<p>To repeat a form of prayer a very large number of times has always seemed to the ignorantly&nbsp;religious&nbsp;to be a praiseworthy thing; but assuredly it is not so. It is a mere&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;of memory, and of the organs of&nbsp;noise-making: and it is absurd to&nbsp;imagine&nbsp;that such a parrot&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;can be pleasing to the living&nbsp;God. The Mahometans and Papists keep to this heathenish&nbsp;custom; but we must not&nbsp;imitate&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>God&nbsp;does not need us to&nbsp;pray&nbsp;for his information, for he “knoweth what things ye have need of&nbsp;”; nor to repeat the prayer over and over for his persuasion, for as our&nbsp;Father&nbsp;he is willing to&nbsp;bless&nbsp;us. Therefore let us not be superstitious and&nbsp;dream&nbsp;that there is&nbsp;virtue&nbsp;in “much speaking&nbsp;.” In the multitude of words, even in prayer, there wanteth not&nbsp;sin.</p>
<p>Repetitions we may have, but not “vain&nbsp;repetitions.&nbsp;” Counting beads, and reckoning the time occupied in&nbsp;devotion, are both idle things. Christians’ prayers are measured by weight, and not by length. Many of the most prevailing prayers have been as short as they were&nbsp;strong.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:9" name="6:9"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.9;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.9" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:9</a>.&nbsp;After this manner therefore&nbsp;pray&nbsp;ye: Our&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which art in&nbsp;heaven,&nbsp;Hallowed&nbsp;be thy name.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;Lord, having&nbsp;warned&nbsp;us against certain vices which had connected themselves with prayer as to its place and spirit, now gives us a model upon which to fashion our prayers. This delightful prayer is short,&nbsp;devout, and full of meaning Its first three petitions are for&nbsp;God&nbsp;and his&nbsp;glory. Our&nbsp;chief&nbsp;prayers to&nbsp;God&nbsp;are to be for his&nbsp;glory. Do we thus begin with&nbsp;God&nbsp;in prayer? Does not the&nbsp;daily&nbsp;bread&nbsp;often come in before the&nbsp;kingdom?</p>
<p>We&nbsp;pray&nbsp;as&nbsp;children&nbsp;to a&nbsp;Father, and we&nbsp;pray&nbsp;as&nbsp;brothers, for we say, “Our&nbsp;Father.” “Our&nbsp;Father&nbsp;” is a familiar name, but the words “which art in&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;” suggest the&nbsp;reverence&nbsp;due unto him. Our&nbsp;Father&nbsp;and yet in&nbsp;heaven: in&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;and yet our&nbsp;Father. May his name be treated reverently, and may all that is about him—his Word and his gospel—be regarded with the deepest awe! It is for us so to&nbsp;walk&nbsp;before the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;in all&nbsp;lowliness, that all shall see that we&nbsp;reverence&nbsp;the character of the thrice-holy One. Then can we truly&nbsp;pray, “Hallowed&nbsp;be thy name&nbsp;”, when we&nbsp;hallow&nbsp;it ourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:10" name="6:10"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.10;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.10" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:10</a>.&nbsp;Thy&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;come, Thy will be done in&nbsp;earth, as It is in&nbsp;heaven.</p>
<p>Oh, that thou mayest&nbsp;reign&nbsp;over all&nbsp;hearts&nbsp;and&nbsp;lands! Men have thrown off their allegiance to our&nbsp;Father,&nbsp;God; and we&nbsp;pray&nbsp;with all our might that he may, by his&nbsp;almighty&nbsp;grace,&nbsp;subdue&nbsp;them to loyal obedience. We long for the coming of King&nbsp;Jesus; but meanwhile we&nbsp;cry&nbsp;to our&nbsp;Father, “Thy&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;come.” We desire for the&nbsp;supreme&nbsp;will&nbsp;to be done in&nbsp;earth,&nbsp;with a&nbsp;cheerful, constant, universal obedience like that of “heaven.” We would have the Lord’s will carried out, not only by the great physical forces which never&nbsp;fail&nbsp;to be&nbsp;obedient&nbsp;to&nbsp;God, but by lovingly active spirits; by men, once rebellious, but graciously&nbsp;renewed. Oh, Oh, that all who say this prayer may display on&nbsp;earth&nbsp;the holy alacrity of obedience which is seen in the&nbsp;happy, hearty, united, and unquestioning service of&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;saints&nbsp;and&nbsp;angels&nbsp;before the throng. Our heart’s highest wish is for God’s&nbsp;honor,&nbsp;dominion, and&nbsp;glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:11" name="6:11"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.11;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.11" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:11</a>.&nbsp;Give us this day our&nbsp;daily&nbsp;bread.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;pray&nbsp;for providential supplies for ourselves and others — “Give&nbsp;us&nbsp;.”</p>
<p>We ask for our&nbsp;food&nbsp;as a&nbsp;gift&nbsp;— Give us.” We request no more than&nbsp;bread,&nbsp;or&nbsp;food&nbsp;needful for us. Our petition concerns the day, and asks only for a&nbsp;daily&nbsp;supply;&nbsp;bread&nbsp;enough for this day. We ask not for&nbsp;bread&nbsp;which&nbsp;belongs&nbsp;to others, but only for that which is honestly our own, — “our&nbsp;daily&nbsp;bread.&nbsp;” It is the prayer of a lowly and contented&nbsp;mind, of one who is so sanctified that he waits upon&nbsp;God&nbsp;even about his&nbsp;daily&nbsp;food, and of one who lovingly links others with himself in his sympathy and prayer.</p>
<p>Give me,&nbsp;Lord, both the&nbsp;bread&nbsp;of&nbsp;heaven, and of&nbsp;earth: that which&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;my&nbsp;soul, and sustains my body. For all I look to thee, my&nbsp;Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:12" name="6:12"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.12;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.12" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:12</a>.&nbsp;And&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;us our&nbsp;debts&nbsp;as we&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;our&nbsp;debtors.</p>
<p>No prayer of&nbsp;mortal&nbsp;men could be complete without confession of&nbsp;sin.</p>
<p>Prayer which does not&nbsp;seek&nbsp;for pardon will&nbsp;fail, as the Pharisee’s prayer did. Let&nbsp;proud&nbsp;men&nbsp;boast&nbsp;as they please, those who are in Christ’s&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;will always&nbsp;pray, “Forgive&nbsp;us our&nbsp;debts&nbsp;.” Our&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;knew that we should always have&nbsp;debts&nbsp;to own, and therefore would always need to&nbsp;cry, “Forgive!&nbsp;“This is the prayer of men whom the&nbsp;Judge&nbsp;has absolved because of their&nbsp;faith&nbsp;in the Great&nbsp;Sacrifice; for now to their&nbsp;Father&nbsp;they come for free&nbsp;forgiveness, as&nbsp;children. No man may pass a day without praying “Forgive”; and in his&nbsp;supplication&nbsp;he should not&nbsp;forget&nbsp;his fellow-sinners, but should&nbsp;pray&nbsp;“Forgive us.” The writer ventures to&nbsp;pray, “Lord,&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;me, and my&nbsp;brother&nbsp;over yonder, who says he is&nbsp;perfect.”</p>
<p>This pardon we can only obtain as we freely pass over the offenses of others against ourselves: “as we&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;our&nbsp;debtors.&nbsp;” This is a reasonable, nay, a&nbsp;blessed&nbsp;requirement, which it is a&nbsp;delight&nbsp;to&nbsp;fulfill. It would not be&nbsp;safe&nbsp;for&nbsp;God&nbsp;to&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;a man who will not&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Lord, I most heartily&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;all who may have done me wrong, I am lenient with those who are&nbsp;indebted&nbsp;to me; and now, with a&nbsp;hopeful&nbsp;heart, I&nbsp;pray&nbsp;thee&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;me,&nbsp;as surer, as I now&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;all who are in and sense my&nbsp;debtors.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:13" name="6:13"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.13;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.13" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:13</a>.&nbsp;And lead us not into&nbsp;temptation, but&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;us from&nbsp;evil: For thine is the&nbsp;kingdom, and the&nbsp;power, and the&nbsp;glory, for ever.&nbsp;Amen.</p>
<p>In the course of providence, the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;tests our graces and the&nbsp;sincerity&nbsp;of our profession; and for this purpose he does “leads us into&nbsp;temptation.&nbsp;” We entreat him not to try us too severely.&nbsp;Lord, let not my joys or my&nbsp;sorrows&nbsp;become&nbsp;temptations&nbsp;to me. As I would not&nbsp;run&nbsp;into&nbsp;temptation&nbsp;of myself, I&nbsp;pray&nbsp;thee, do not lead me where I must inevitably meet it.</p>
<p>But if I must be tried,&nbsp;Lord,&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;me&nbsp;from&nbsp;falling into&nbsp;evil,&nbsp;and specially&nbsp;preserve&nbsp;me from that&nbsp;evil&nbsp;one,&nbsp;who, above all,&nbsp;seeks&nbsp;my&nbsp;soul, to&nbsp;destroy&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Temptation&nbsp;or&nbsp;trial&nbsp;may be for my good, if I am&nbsp;delivered&nbsp;from&nbsp;evil.</p>
<p>Lord, do this for me, for I cannot&nbsp;preserve&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>The prayer&nbsp;finishes&nbsp;with a doxology. That&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;which begins with prayer ends in&nbsp;praise. All rule, and might and&nbsp;honor,&nbsp;belong&nbsp;to&nbsp;God; and to him let them for ever be ascribed. His is “the&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;”,&nbsp;or the right to rule; “the&nbsp;power&nbsp;”,&nbsp;or the might to uphold his&nbsp;authority; and “the&nbsp;glory&nbsp;”,&nbsp;or the&nbsp;honor&nbsp;that comes out of his&nbsp;government. Our whole&nbsp;heart&nbsp;delights&nbsp;that the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;is thus&nbsp;supreme&nbsp;and glorious; and therefore&nbsp;we say,&nbsp;“Amen.&nbsp;” How&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;is this model of prayer! So fit for man to&nbsp;pray, so suitable to be laid before the throng of the&nbsp;Majesty&nbsp;on High. Oh, that we may have&nbsp;grace&nbsp;to copy it all our days!&nbsp;Jesus, our King, will not refuse to present a prayer which is of his own drawing up and is directed to the&nbsp;Father&nbsp;whom he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;to&nbsp;glorify.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:14" name="6:14"></a><a id="6:15" name="6:15"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.14;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.14" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:14</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%206.15;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 6.15" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15</a>.&nbsp;For if ye&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;men their trespasses, your heavenly&nbsp;Father&nbsp;will also&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;you: but if ye&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;not men their trespasses, neither will your&nbsp;Father&nbsp;forgive&nbsp;your trespasses&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enforces&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;action by limiting the&nbsp;power&nbsp;of prayer according to our obedience to the command to&nbsp;forgive. If we would be&nbsp;forgiven, we must&nbsp;forgive: if we will not&nbsp;forgive, we cannot be&nbsp;forgiven. This yoke is easy; this burden is&nbsp;light. It may be a&nbsp;blessing&nbsp;to be wronged, since it affords us an opportunity of judging whether we are indeed the recipients of the pardon which comes from the&nbsp;throne&nbsp;of&nbsp;God. Very sweet is it to pass by other men’s offenses against ourselves; for thus we&nbsp;learn&nbsp;how sweet it is to the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;to pardon us.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:16" name="6:16"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.16;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.16" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:16</a>.&nbsp;Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the&nbsp;hypocrites&nbsp;of a&nbsp;sad&nbsp;countenance: for they&nbsp;disfigure&nbsp;their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, they have their&nbsp;reward.</p>
<p>Having dealt with prayer, our King now&nbsp;instructs&nbsp;us&nbsp;as to&nbsp;fasting.&nbsp;Fasting&nbsp;took a leading place in&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;under the&nbsp;Law, and it might profitably be more practiced even now under the&nbsp;Gospel. The Puritans called it “soul-fattening fasting”, and so many have found it. We must, by order of our King,&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;all attempt at display in connection with this form of&nbsp;devotion.&nbsp;Hypocrites&nbsp;went about with faces&nbsp;unwashed, and dolorous, that all might say, “See how rigidly those men are&nbsp;fasting. What good men the, must be!” To look&nbsp;miserable&nbsp;in order to be thought holy- is a&nbsp;wretched&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;hypocrisy; and as it makes&nbsp;fasting&nbsp;into a trick to catch human admiration, it thereby&nbsp;destroys&nbsp;it as a means of&nbsp;grace. We cannot expect to get a&nbsp;reward&nbsp;both from the&nbsp;praise&nbsp;of our fellows and the&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>We have our choice; and if we&nbsp;snatch&nbsp;at the minor&nbsp;reward, we&nbsp;love&nbsp;the major. May it never be said of us,&nbsp;“They have their&nbsp;reward.&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:17" name="6:17"></a><a id="6:18" name="6:18"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.17;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.17" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:17</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%206.18;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 6.18" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18</a>.&nbsp;But thou, when thou fastest,&nbsp;anoint&nbsp;thine head, and&nbsp;wash&nbsp;thy face; that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which is in&nbsp;secret: and thy&nbsp;Father, which seeth in&nbsp;secret, shall&nbsp;reward&nbsp;thee openly.</p>
<p>Use&nbsp;diligence&nbsp;to conceal what it would be foolish to parade. Leave off no outward act of personal cleanliness or adornment; “anoint&nbsp;thine head, and&nbsp;wash&nbsp;thy face.&nbsp;” If your&nbsp;fasting&nbsp;is unto&nbsp;God, keep it for him. Act in&nbsp;seasons&nbsp;of extraordinary&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;as you do at other times, that those with whom you come in contact may not know what special&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;you are practicing. You may fast, and that lasting may, be&nbsp;discovered; but let it be no intent of, yours that you should “appear unto men to fast.&nbsp;” Fast from&nbsp;vainglory,&nbsp;ambition,&nbsp;pride, and self-glorification. Fast in&nbsp;secret&nbsp;before the Seer of&nbsp;secrets.&nbsp;Secret&nbsp;fasting&nbsp;shall have an open&nbsp;reward&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Lord; but that which is done out of mere ostentation shall never be reckoned in the books of the&nbsp;Lord. Thus our King has taught us both how to give&nbsp;alms, how to&nbsp;pray, and how to fast; and he will now proceed to legislate for the concerns of&nbsp;daily&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>He would not have his&nbsp;servants&nbsp;seeking two objects, and serving two masters. He calls them away from&nbsp;anxieties&nbsp;about this&nbsp;life&nbsp;to a restful&nbsp;faith&nbsp;in&nbsp;God</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:19" name="6:19"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.19;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.19" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:19</a>.&nbsp;Lay not up for yourselves&nbsp;treasures&nbsp;upon&nbsp;earth, where&nbsp;moth&nbsp;and rust doth&nbsp;corrupt, and where&nbsp;thieves&nbsp;break&nbsp;through and&nbsp;steal.</p>
<p>Lay not out your&nbsp;life&nbsp;for gathering&nbsp;wealth: this would be degrading to you as&nbsp;servants&nbsp;of the heavenly&nbsp;kingdom. It you accumulate either&nbsp;money&nbsp;or&nbsp;raiment, your&nbsp;treasures&nbsp;will be liable to “moth&nbsp;and rust&nbsp;”;&nbsp;and of both you may be deprived by&nbsp;dishonest&nbsp;men. That earthly things&nbsp;decay, or are taken from us, is an excellent reason for not making them the great objects of our pursuit. Hoard not for&nbsp;thieves,&nbsp;gather&nbsp;not for&nbsp;corruption: accumulate for&nbsp;eternity, and send your&nbsp;treasures&nbsp;into the&nbsp;land&nbsp;whither you are going. To&nbsp;live&nbsp;for the sake of growing&nbsp;rich&nbsp;is a gilded&nbsp;death&nbsp;in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:20" name="6:20"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.20;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.20" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:20</a>.&nbsp;But lay up for yourselves&nbsp;treasures&nbsp;in&nbsp;heaven, where neither&nbsp;moth&nbsp;nor rust doth&nbsp;corrupt, and where&nbsp;thieves&nbsp;do not&nbsp;break&nbsp;through or&nbsp;steal.</p>
<p>Let our desires and efforts go after heavenly things. These are not liable to any&nbsp;decay&nbsp;within themselves, nor can they be taken from us by force or&nbsp;fraud. Does not&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;bid us&nbsp;seek&nbsp;such sure possessions? Out of our earthly possessions that which is used for&nbsp;God&nbsp;is&nbsp;laid up in&nbsp;heaven.&nbsp;What is given to the&nbsp;poor&nbsp;and to the Lord’s cause is deposited in the&nbsp;Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;Eternity. To&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;we are going; let us send our&nbsp;treasures&nbsp;before us.</p>
<p>There they will be&nbsp;safe&nbsp;from&nbsp;decay, and robbery: but in no other place may we reckon them to be&nbsp;secure.</p>
<p>Lord, let me be&nbsp;rich&nbsp;towards thee. I had better send on to my treasury in&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;more of my substance than I have already sent. I will at once remember the&nbsp;Church&nbsp;and its Missions, orphans, aged&nbsp;saints, and&nbsp;poor&nbsp;brethren: these are thy treasury boxes, and I will&nbsp;bank&nbsp;my&nbsp;money&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>This is a grand&nbsp;moral&nbsp;motive for keeping our desires above groveling objects. The&nbsp;heart&nbsp;must and will go in the direction of that which we&nbsp;count&nbsp;precious. The whole man will be&nbsp;transformed&nbsp;into the likeness of that for which he lives. Where we place our&nbsp;treasures&nbsp;our thoughts will naturally&nbsp;fly&nbsp;It will be&nbsp;wise&nbsp;to let all that we have act as magnets to draw us in the right direction. If our very&nbsp;best&nbsp;things are in&nbsp;heaven, our very&nbsp;best&nbsp;thoughts will&nbsp;fly&nbsp;in the same direction: but if our choicest possessions are of the&nbsp;earth, our&nbsp;heart&nbsp;will be&nbsp;earth-bound.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:22" name="6:22"></a><a id="6:23" name="6:23"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.22;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.22" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:22</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%206.23;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 6.23" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23</a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;light&nbsp;of the body is the&nbsp;eye: if therefore thine&nbsp;eye&nbsp;be single thy whole body shall be full of&nbsp;light. But if thine&nbsp;eye&nbsp;be&nbsp;evil, thy whole body shall be full of&nbsp;darkness. If therefore the&nbsp;light&nbsp;that is in thee be&nbsp;darkness, how great is that&nbsp;darkness.</p>
<p>The motive is the&nbsp;eye&nbsp;of the&nbsp;soul, and if it be clear, the whole character will be right; but if it be polluted, our whole being will become&nbsp;defiled. The&nbsp;eye&nbsp;of the understanding may also be here understood: if a man does not see things in a right&nbsp;light, he may&nbsp;live&nbsp;in&nbsp;sin&nbsp;and yet fancy that he is doing his&nbsp;duty. A man should&nbsp;live&nbsp;up to his&nbsp;light; but if that&nbsp;light&nbsp;is itself&nbsp;darkness, what a mistake his whole course will be! If our&nbsp;religion&nbsp;leads us to&nbsp;sin, it is worse than irreligion. If our&nbsp;faith&nbsp;is presumption, our&nbsp;zeal&nbsp;selfishness, our prayer formality, our&nbsp;hope&nbsp;a delusion, our experience infatuation, the&nbsp;darkness&nbsp;is so great that even our&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;holds up his&nbsp;hands&nbsp;in astonishment and says — “How great is&nbsp;that&nbsp;darkness!&nbsp;“ Oh, for a single&nbsp;eye&nbsp;to God’s&nbsp;glory, a sincere&nbsp;consecration&nbsp;unto the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;This alone can fill my&nbsp;soul&nbsp;with&nbsp;light.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:24" name="6:24"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.24;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.24" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:24</a>.&nbsp;No man can serve two masters: for either be will&nbsp;hate&nbsp;the one, and&nbsp;love&nbsp;the other; or else he will hold to the one, and&nbsp;despise&nbsp;the other. Ye cannot serve&nbsp;God&nbsp;and&nbsp;mammon.</p>
<p>Here our King forbids&nbsp;division&nbsp;of aim in&nbsp;life. We cannot have two&nbsp;master&nbsp;passions: if we could, it would be&nbsp;impossible&nbsp;to serve both; their interests would soon come into&nbsp;conflict, and we should be forced to choose between them.&nbsp;God&nbsp;and the&nbsp;world&nbsp;will never agree, and however much we may attempt it, we shall never be able to serve both. Our&nbsp;danger&nbsp;is that in trying to&nbsp;gain&nbsp;money, or in the pursuit of any other object, we should put it out of its place, and allow it to get the mastery of our&nbsp;mind.&nbsp;Gain&nbsp;and&nbsp;godliness&nbsp;cannot both be masters of our&nbsp;souls: we can serve&nbsp;two,&nbsp;but not “two masters.&nbsp;” You can&nbsp;live&nbsp;for this&nbsp;world, or&nbsp;live&nbsp;for the next; but to&nbsp;live&nbsp;equally for both is&nbsp;impossible. Where&nbsp;God&nbsp;reigns, the&nbsp;lust&nbsp;of&nbsp;gain&nbsp;must go.</p>
<p>Oh, to be so decided, that we may&nbsp;pursue&nbsp;one thing only! We would&nbsp;hate&nbsp;evil&nbsp;and&nbsp;love&nbsp;God,&nbsp;despise&nbsp;falsehood&nbsp;and&nbsp;hold to&nbsp;truth! We need to know how we are affected both to&nbsp;righteousness&nbsp;and&nbsp;sin; and when this is ascertained to our&nbsp;comfort, we must stand to the right with uncompromising firmness.&nbsp;Mammon&nbsp;is the direct opposite of&nbsp;God&nbsp;as much today as in past ages, and we must loathe its&nbsp;greed, its selfishness, its oppression, its&nbsp;pride; or we do not&nbsp;love&nbsp;God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:25" name="6:25"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.25;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.25" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:25</a>.&nbsp;Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your&nbsp;life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the&nbsp;life&nbsp;more than&nbsp;meat, and the body than&nbsp;raiment.’&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>Therefore</strong>,&nbsp;” in order that our one Master may be served, we must cease from serving self, and from the carking care which self-seeking involves.</p>
<p>Read the passage, “<strong>Be not anxious for your&nbsp;life.</strong>&nbsp;” Thought we may take; but anxious, carking care we must not know. Our most pressing bodily wants are not to engross our minds. Our&nbsp;life&nbsp;is more important than the&nbsp;food&nbsp;we eat, or the&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;we wear.&nbsp;God&nbsp;who gives us&nbsp;life&nbsp;will give us&nbsp;bread&nbsp;and&nbsp;raiment. We should much more care how we&nbsp;live&nbsp;than how we eat: the&nbsp;spiritual&nbsp;should go before the bodily, the&nbsp;eternal&nbsp;before the temporal. What we wear is of very&nbsp;small&nbsp;importance compared with what we are. Therefore let us give our&nbsp;chief&nbsp;care to that which is&nbsp;chief, yea, our sole thought to the one all-absorbing object of all true&nbsp;life, the&nbsp;glory&nbsp;of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:26" name="6:26"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.26;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.26" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:26</a>.&nbsp;Behold the&nbsp;fowls&nbsp;of the&nbsp;air: for they sow not, neither do they&nbsp;reap, nor&nbsp;gather&nbsp;into&nbsp;barns; yet your heavenly&nbsp;Father&nbsp;feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>
<p>The&nbsp;birds&nbsp;are fed by&nbsp;God; will he not&nbsp;feed&nbsp;us? They are free from the fret which comes of hoarding and&nbsp;trading; why should not we be? If&nbsp;God&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;the&nbsp;fowls&nbsp;of the&nbsp;air&nbsp;without sowing, or reaping, or storing, surely he will supply us when we trustfully use these means. For us to rely upon these means and&nbsp;forget&nbsp;our&nbsp;God&nbsp;would be&nbsp;folly&nbsp;indeed. Our King would have his subjects give their&nbsp;hearts&nbsp;to his&nbsp;love&nbsp;and service, and not worry themselves with groveling&nbsp;anxieties. It is well for us that we have these&nbsp;daily&nbsp;wants, because they lead us to our heavenly&nbsp;Father; but if we grow anxious, they are turned from their design and made into barriers to shut us out from the&nbsp;Lord. Oh, that we would be as good as the&nbsp;birds&nbsp;in trustfulness, since in&nbsp;dignity&nbsp;of&nbsp;nature&nbsp;we are so “much better than they&nbsp;”!</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:27" name="6:27"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.27;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.27" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:27</a>.&nbsp;Which of you by taking thought can add one&nbsp;cubit&nbsp;unto his stature?</p>
<p>It is a&nbsp;small&nbsp;matter whether we are tall or short; and yet all the worry in the&nbsp;world&nbsp;could not make us an inch taller. Why, then, do we give way to care about things which we cannot alter? If fretting were of any use it would have some excuse; but as it does no good, let us cease from it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.28;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.28" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:28</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%206.29;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 6.29" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29</a>.&nbsp;And why take ye thought for&nbsp;raiment? Consider the&nbsp;lilies&nbsp;of the&nbsp;field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin&nbsp;:&nbsp;and yet I say unto you, That even&nbsp;Solomon&nbsp;in all his&nbsp;glory&nbsp;was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p>Clothes&nbsp;must not be made much of; for in our finest array,&nbsp;flowers&nbsp;far&nbsp;excel&nbsp;us. We must not be anxious about how we shall be clad; for the&nbsp;field&nbsp;lilies,&nbsp;not under the gardener’s care, are as glorious as the most pompous of monarchs; and yet they&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;life&nbsp;free from&nbsp;labor&nbsp;and thought.&nbsp;Lovely&nbsp;lilies, how ye&nbsp;rebuke&nbsp;our foolish nervousness! The array of&nbsp;lilies&nbsp;comes without fret: why do we&nbsp;kill&nbsp;ourselves with care about that which&nbsp;God&nbsp;gives to&nbsp;plants&nbsp;which cannot care?</p>
<p>My&nbsp;Lord, I would grow to thy&nbsp;praise&nbsp;as the&nbsp;lily&nbsp;cloth, and be content to be what thou&nbsp;cost&nbsp;make me, and wear what thou&nbsp;cost&nbsp;give me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:30" name="6:30"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.30;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.30" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:30</a>.&nbsp;Wherefore, if&nbsp;God&nbsp;so clothe the&nbsp;grass&nbsp;of the&nbsp;field, which to day is, and tomorrow is cast into the&nbsp;oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little&nbsp;faith&nbsp;It is not merely that&nbsp;lilies&nbsp;grow, but that&nbsp;God&nbsp;himself&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;them with surpassing&nbsp;beauty,</p>
<p>These&nbsp;lilies, when growing, appear only as&nbsp;the&nbsp;grass,&nbsp;commonplace enough; but&nbsp;Solomon&nbsp;could not&nbsp;excel&nbsp;them when&nbsp;God&nbsp;has put them in their full array of&nbsp;cloth&nbsp;of&nbsp;gold. Will he not be sure to take care of us, who are precious in his sight? Why should we be so little trustful as to have a doubt upon that point? If that which is so very short lived is yet so bedecked of the&nbsp;Lord, depend upon it, he will&nbsp;guard&nbsp;immortal&nbsp;minds, and even the&nbsp;mortal&nbsp;bodies with which they are associated. “Little&nbsp;faith&nbsp;” is not a little fault; for it greatly wrongs the&nbsp;Lord, and&nbsp;sadly&nbsp;grieves&nbsp;the fretful&nbsp;mind. To think the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;who&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;lilies&nbsp;will leave his own&nbsp;children&nbsp;naked&nbsp;is shameful. O little&nbsp;faith,&nbsp;learn&nbsp;better manners!</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:31" name="6:31"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.31;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.31" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:31</a>.&nbsp;Therefore take no thought, saying&nbsp;,&nbsp;What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be&nbsp;clothed?&nbsp;“Be not anxious&nbsp;” is the right interpretation. Think, that you may not have to be anxious. Do not for ever be following the worlds&nbsp;Trinity&nbsp;of cares.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;questions&nbsp;in this verse are taken out of the worldlings’ catechism of distrust. The&nbsp;children&nbsp;of&nbsp;God&nbsp;may quietly&nbsp;work&nbsp;on from day to day, and cast all foreboding cares from them;</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:32" name="6:32"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.32;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.32" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:32</a>.&nbsp;(For after all these things do the Gentiles&nbsp;seek:) for your heavenly&nbsp;Father&nbsp;knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
<p>We are to&nbsp;excel&nbsp;those who are aliens and foreigners: things which “Gentiles&nbsp;seek&nbsp;” are not good enough for the&nbsp;Israel&nbsp;of&nbsp;God. The men of the&nbsp;world&nbsp;seek&nbsp;after earthly things, and have no&nbsp;mind&nbsp;for anything beyond: we have a&nbsp;heavenly&nbsp;Father,&nbsp;and therefore we have higher aims and aspirations.</p>
<p>Moreover, as our&nbsp;Father&nbsp;knows all about our necessities, we need not be anxious; for he is quite sure to supply all our needs. Let the Gentiles hunt after their many&nbsp;carnal&nbsp;objects; but let the&nbsp;children&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;leave their temporal wants with the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;of infinite&nbsp;grace, and then let them follow after the one thing needful.</p>
<p>Lord, enable me to be a non-anxious one. May I be so eager after heavenly things, that I altogether leave my earthly cares with thee!</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:33" name="6:33"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.33;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.33" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:33</a>.&nbsp;But&nbsp;seek&nbsp;ye first the&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;of&nbsp;God, and his&nbsp;righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p>Seek&nbsp;God&nbsp;first, and the&nbsp;rest&nbsp;will follow in due course. As for “all these things&nbsp;”, you will&nbsp;not need to&nbsp;seek&nbsp;them; they will be thrown in as a matter of course.&nbsp;God&nbsp;who gives you&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;will not deny you your&nbsp;bread&nbsp;on the road thither.&nbsp;The&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;of&nbsp;God, and the&nbsp;righteousness&nbsp;suitable to that kingdom—seek these first and foremost, and then all that you can possibly need shall be your portion. To promote the&nbsp;reign&nbsp;of&nbsp;Christ, and to&nbsp;practice&nbsp;righteousness, are but one object; and may that be the one aim of our lives!</p>
<p>Let us spend&nbsp;life&nbsp;on the one thing, and it will be well spent: as for the twenty secondary objects, they also will be ours if we&nbsp;pursue&nbsp;the one thing only.</p>
<p class="verse"><a id="6:34" name="6:34"></a><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%206.34;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 6.34" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:34</a>.&nbsp;Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the&nbsp;clay&nbsp;is the&nbsp;evil&nbsp;thereof.</p>
<p>Understand the former verses as the argument to this “therefore.&nbsp;”&nbsp;Anxiety&nbsp;cannot help you (verse 27); it is quite useless, it would degrade you to the level of the&nbsp;heathen&nbsp;(verse 32); and there is no need for it (verse 33) — therefore do not forestall&nbsp;sorrow&nbsp;by being anxious as to the future. Our&nbsp;business&nbsp;is with today: we are only to ask breed day by day, and that only in sufficient&nbsp;abundance&nbsp;for the day’s consumption. To import the possible&nbsp;sorrows&nbsp;of tomorrow into the thoughts of today is a superfluity of&nbsp;unbelief.</p>
<p>When the morrow brings&nbsp;sorrow, it will bring&nbsp;strength&nbsp;for that&nbsp;sorrow.</p>
<p>Today will require all the vigor we have to deal with its immediate evils; there can be no need to import cares from the future. To load today with&nbsp;trials&nbsp;not yet arrived, would be to overload it.&nbsp;Anxiety&nbsp;is&nbsp;evil, but&nbsp;anxiety&nbsp;about things which have not yet happened is altogether without excuse.&nbsp;“Cast foreboding cares away,&nbsp;God&nbsp;provideth for today.”&nbsp;O my&nbsp;heart, what&nbsp;rest&nbsp;there is for thee if thou wilt give thyself up to thy&nbsp;Lord, and leave all thine own concerns with him!&nbsp;Mind&nbsp;thou thy Lord’s&nbsp;business, and he will see to thy&nbsp;business.</p>

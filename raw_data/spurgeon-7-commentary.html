<p class="author">MATTHEW 7:1-12 THE KING CONTINUES TO REGULATE THE BEHAVIOR OF HIS SUBJECTS</p>
<p>He deals with matters in which we come into contact with our fellow men, as he had aforetime set in order our personal&nbsp;devotion&nbsp;towards&nbsp;God, and our private&nbsp;business&nbsp;for ourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.1;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.1" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:1</a>,<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.2;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.2" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>.&nbsp;JUDGE not, that ye be not judged. For with what&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;ye&nbsp;judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your&nbsp;judgment, of course: the verse implies that you will&nbsp;judge&nbsp;in a right sense. But do not indulge the criticizing faculty upon others in a censorious manner, or as if you were set in&nbsp;authority, and had a right to dispense&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;among your fellows If you impute motives, and pretend to read&nbsp;hearts, others will do the same towards you. A hard and censorious behavior is sure to&nbsp;provoke&nbsp;reprisals. Those around you will pick up the peck measure you have been using, and measure your corn with it. You do not object to men forming a fair opinion of your character, neither are you forbidden to do the same towards them; but as you would object to their sitting in&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;upon you, do not sit in&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;upon them. This is not the day of&nbsp;judgment, neither are we his Majesty’s judges, and therefore we may not anticipate the time&nbsp;appointed&nbsp;for the final assize, nor usurp the prerogatives of the&nbsp;Judge&nbsp;of all the&nbsp;earth.</p>
<p>Surely, if I know myself aright, I need not send my&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;upon&nbsp;circuit&nbsp;to try other men; for I can give it full&nbsp;occupation&nbsp;in my own&nbsp;Court&nbsp;of Conscience to try the&nbsp;traitors&nbsp;within my own&nbsp;bosom.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.3;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.3" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:3</a>,<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.4;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.4" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a>,<a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.5;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.5" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5</a>.&nbsp;And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s&nbsp;eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own&nbsp;eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy&nbsp;brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine&nbsp;eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own&nbsp;eye? Thou&nbsp;hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine&nbsp;own&nbsp;eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s&nbsp;eye.</p>
<p>The judging faculty is&nbsp;best&nbsp;employed at&nbsp;home. Our tendency is to&nbsp;spy&nbsp;out splinters in other men’s&nbsp;eyes, and not to see the beam in our own. Instead of&nbsp;beholding,&nbsp;with gratified&nbsp;gaze, the&nbsp;small&nbsp;fault of another, we should act reasonably if we penitently&nbsp;considered&nbsp;the greater fault of ourselves. It is&nbsp;the beam in our own&nbsp;eye&nbsp;which blinds us to our own wrongdoing; but such&nbsp;blindness&nbsp;does not suffice to excuse us, since it evidently does not shut our&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;to the little error of our&nbsp;brother. Officiousness pretends to play the oculist; but in very&nbsp;truth&nbsp;it plays the&nbsp;fool. Fancy a man with a beam in his&nbsp;eye&nbsp;pretending to deal with so tender a part as the&nbsp;eye&nbsp;of another, and attempting to remove so tiny a thing as a&nbsp;mote&nbsp;or splinter! Is he not a&nbsp;hypocrite&nbsp;to pretend to be so concerned about other men’s&nbsp;eyes, and yet he never attends to his own?&nbsp;Jesus&nbsp;is&nbsp;gentle, but he calls that man a “hypocrite&nbsp;” who fusses about&nbsp;small&nbsp;things in others, and pays no attention to great matters at&nbsp;home&nbsp;in his own person. Our reformations must begin with ourselves, or they are not true, and do not spring from a right motive.</p>
<p>Sin&nbsp;we may&nbsp;rebuke, but not if we indulge it. We may&nbsp;protest&nbsp;against&nbsp;evil, but not if we willfully&nbsp;practice&nbsp;it. The&nbsp;Pharisees&nbsp;were great at censuring, but slow at amending. Our&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;will not have his&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;made up of hypocritical theorists, he calls for practical obedience to the rules of&nbsp;holiness.</p>
<p>After we are ourselves sanctified, we are bound to be&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;to the&nbsp;blind, and correctors of&nbsp;unholy&nbsp;living; but not till then. Till we have personal&nbsp;piety, our&nbsp;preaching&nbsp;of&nbsp;godliness&nbsp;is sheer&nbsp;hypocrisy. May none of us&nbsp;provoke&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;to say to us, “Thou&nbsp;hypocrite&nbsp;”!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.6;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.6" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:6</a>.&nbsp;Give not that which is holy unto the days, neither cast ye your&nbsp;pearls&nbsp;before&nbsp;swine, lest they&nbsp;trample&nbsp;them under their&nbsp;feet, and turn again and rend you.</p>
<p>When men are evidently unable to perceive the&nbsp;purity&nbsp;of a great&nbsp;truth, do not set it before them. They are like mere&nbsp;dog,&nbsp;and if you set holy things before them they will be&nbsp;provoked&nbsp;to “turn again and rend you&nbsp;”:&nbsp;holy things are not for the&nbsp;profane. “Without are dogs”: they must not be allowed to enter the holy place. When you are in the midst of the vicious, who are like “swine,&nbsp;” do not bring forth the precious&nbsp;mysteries&nbsp;of the&nbsp;faith, for they will&nbsp;despise&nbsp;them, and “trample&nbsp;them under their&nbsp;feet&nbsp;” in the mire.</p>
<p>You are not needlessly to&nbsp;provoke&nbsp;attack upon yourself, or upon the higher truths of the&nbsp;gospel. You are not to&nbsp;judge, but you are not to act without&nbsp;judgment.&nbsp;Count&nbsp;not men to be&nbsp;dogs&nbsp;or&nbsp;swine; but when they avow themselves to be such, or by their&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;act as if they were such, do not put occasions in their way for displaying their&nbsp;evil&nbsp;character.&nbsp;Saints&nbsp;are not to be simpletons; they are not to be judges, but, also, they are not to be&nbsp;fools.</p>
<p>Great King, how much&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;thy&nbsp;precepts&nbsp;require! I need thee, not only to open my mouth, but also at times to keep it shut.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.7;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.7" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:7</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%207.8;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 7.8" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a>.&nbsp;Ask, and it shall be given you;&nbsp;seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
<p>To men you may not always speak of heavenly things, but to&nbsp;God&nbsp;you may. “Ask,&nbsp;seek, knock&nbsp;”;&nbsp;let your prayer be adapted to the case; let it increase in intensity; let it advance in the largeness of its object. To receive a&nbsp;gift&nbsp;is simple, to find a&nbsp;treasure&nbsp;is more enriching, to enter into a&nbsp;palace&nbsp;is&nbsp;best&nbsp;of all. Each form of prayer is prescribed, accepted, and&nbsp;rewarded&nbsp;in a manner suitable to its character. The&nbsp;promise&nbsp;is universal to all who obey the&nbsp;precept. The commands are in opposition to the methods of carking care which have been denounced in the former chapter; and they are encouragements to the&nbsp;precepts&nbsp;of giving and non-resistance set forth previously, since he that can have of&nbsp;God&nbsp;for the asking may well give to men who ask, and even yield to those who unjustly demand. With such boundless stores at command, we should not be either niggardly or litigious.&nbsp;Lord, help me to have done with fretting, and to abound in asking, seeking, knocking; so shall I soon overflow with thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.9;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.9" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:9</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%207.10;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 7.10" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10</a>.&nbsp;Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask&nbsp;bread, will he give him a&nbsp;stone? Or if he ask a&nbsp;fish, will he give him a&nbsp;serpent?</p>
<p>In temporal things we make blunders, and ask for that as&nbsp;bread&nbsp;which we think to be so, when in&nbsp;truth&nbsp;it is a&nbsp;stone. We mistake a&nbsp;serpent&nbsp;for an eel, and beg for it as for a&nbsp;fish. Our heavenly&nbsp;Father&nbsp;will correct our prayer, and give us, not what we ignorantly&nbsp;seek, but what we really need. The&nbsp;promise&nbsp;to give what we ask is here explained, and set in its true&nbsp;light. This is a gracious correction of the&nbsp;folly&nbsp;which would read the Lord’s words in the most literal sense, and make us&nbsp;dream&nbsp;that every whim of ours had only to put on the&nbsp;dress&nbsp;of prayer in order to its realization. Our prayers go to&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;in a Revised Version. It would be a&nbsp;terrible&nbsp;thing if&nbsp;God&nbsp;always gave us all we asked for. Our heavenly&nbsp;Father&nbsp;himself “knows how to give&nbsp;”&nbsp;far&nbsp;better than we know how to ask.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.11;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.11" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:11</a>.&nbsp;If ye then, being&nbsp;evil, know how to give good&nbsp;gifts&nbsp;unto your&nbsp;children, how much more shall your&nbsp;Father&nbsp;which is in&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;give good things to them that ask him?</p>
<p>We, although ourselves&nbsp;evil, correct our children’s blunders in their requests to us, and much more will our all-wise, and good, heavenly&nbsp;Father&nbsp;amend in his bestowals the errors of our beseechings. He will give the good which we did not ask, and withhold the&nbsp;ill&nbsp;which we so unwisely requested.</p>
<p>We know our&nbsp;children&nbsp;and know for our&nbsp;children; and yet we are&nbsp;poor,&nbsp;evil&nbsp;creatures: shall not the perfectly good&nbsp;Father, who knows all things, arrange his&nbsp;gifts&nbsp;most graciously? Yes, we are sure he will. “How much more&nbsp;”!&nbsp;says our&nbsp;Lord, and he does not say how much more, but&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;that&nbsp;to our meditations. We know not what we should&nbsp;pray&nbsp;for as we ought, but he knows how to give as becometh his&nbsp;perfection; and he will do so.</p>
<p>He will give “good things&nbsp;”,&nbsp;and especially his&nbsp;Holy Spirit, who is all good things in one.&nbsp;Lord, I would think more of Thee than of my own prayer; more of thy Son than of my own&nbsp;faith; and more of thy&nbsp;Holy Spirit&nbsp;than of all good&nbsp;gifts&nbsp;beside.</p>

<p>Everything that has gone before leads up to this, and argues for it, and so he says “therefore.&nbsp;” It will be instructive to look back, and think this out.</p>
<p>Let my reader set about it.</p>
<p>In this place our King gives usHIS GOLDEN RULE. Put yourself in anther’s place, and then act to him as you would wish him to act towards you under the same circumstances. This is a right&nbsp;royal&nbsp;rule, a&nbsp;precept&nbsp;always at&nbsp;hand, always applicable, always right. Here you may be a&nbsp;judge, and yet not be judging others, but judging for others. This is the sum of the Decalogue, the&nbsp;Pentateuch, and the whole&nbsp;sacred&nbsp;Word.</p>
<p>Oh, that all men acted on it, and then there would be no&nbsp;slavery, no&nbsp;war, no sweating, no striking, no&nbsp;lying, no robbing; but all would be&nbsp;justice&nbsp;and&nbsp;love! What a&nbsp;kingdom&nbsp;is this which has such a&nbsp;law! This is The Code&nbsp;Christian. This is the condensation of all that is right and generous. We adore the King out of whose mouth and&nbsp;heart&nbsp;such a&nbsp;law&nbsp;could flow. This one rule is a&nbsp;proof&nbsp;of the&nbsp;divinity&nbsp;of our holy&nbsp;religion. The universal&nbsp;practice&nbsp;of it by all who call themselves&nbsp;Christians&nbsp;would carry&nbsp;conviction&nbsp;to&nbsp;Jew, Turk, and&nbsp;infidel, with greater&nbsp;speed&nbsp;and certainty than all the apologies and arguments which the wit or&nbsp;piety&nbsp;of men could produce.</p>
<p>Lord,&nbsp;teach&nbsp;it to me!&nbsp;Write&nbsp;it on the fleshy tablets of my&nbsp;renewed&nbsp;heart!</p>
<p>Write&nbsp;it out in full in my&nbsp;life!</p>

<p>Be up and on your&nbsp;journey. Enter in at the&nbsp;gate&nbsp;at the head of the way, and do not stand hesitating. If it be the right road, you will find the&nbsp;entrance&nbsp;somewhat difficult, and exceedingly&nbsp;narrow;&nbsp;for it demands self-denial, and calls for strictness of obedience, and watchfulness of spirit. Nevertheless, “enter ye in at the strait&nbsp;gate.&nbsp;” Whatever its drawbacks of fewness of&nbsp;pilgrims, or straitness of&nbsp;entrance, yet choose it, and use it. True, there is another road,&nbsp;broad&nbsp;and much frequented; but&nbsp;it leadeth to&nbsp;destruction.</p>
<p>Men go to&nbsp;ruin&nbsp;along the turnpike-road, but the way to&nbsp;heaven&nbsp;is a&nbsp;bridle-path. There may come other days, when the many will&nbsp;crowd&nbsp;the narrow way; but, at this time, to be popular one must be&nbsp;broad —broad&nbsp;in&nbsp;doctrine, in&nbsp;morals, and in spirituals. But those on the strait road shall go straight to&nbsp;glory, and those on the broad road are all abroad. All is well that ends well: we can afford to be straitened in the right way rather than&nbsp;enlarged&nbsp;in the wrong way; because the first endeth in&nbsp;endless&nbsp;life, and the second hastens down to&nbsp;everlasting&nbsp;death.</p>
<p>Lord,&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;me from the&nbsp;temptation&nbsp;to be “broad&nbsp;”,&nbsp;and keep me in the narrow way though few find it!</p>

<p>We have need of our judgments, and we must try the spirits of those who profess to be sent of&nbsp;God. There are men of great&nbsp;gifts&nbsp;who are “false&nbsp;prophets&nbsp;” These affect the look,&nbsp;language, and spirit of God’s people, while really they long to&nbsp;devour&nbsp;souls, even as&nbsp;wolves&nbsp;thirst&nbsp;for the&nbsp;blood&nbsp;of&nbsp;sheep. “Sheep’s&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;”&nbsp;is&nbsp;all very fine, but we must look beneath it and&nbsp;spy&nbsp;out the&nbsp;wolves.&nbsp;A man is what he is&nbsp;inwardly.&nbsp;We had need&nbsp;beware.&nbsp;This&nbsp;precept&nbsp;is timely at this hour. We must be careful not only about our way, but about our&nbsp;leaders. They come to us; they come as&nbsp;prophets; they come with every outward commendation; but they are very Balaams, and will surely&nbsp;curse&nbsp;those they pretend to&nbsp;bless.</p>

Do men&nbsp;gather&nbsp;grapes&nbsp;of&nbsp;thorns, or&nbsp;figs&nbsp;of&nbsp;thistles?</p>
<p>Their teaching, their living, and their effect upon our minds will be a sure test to us. Every&nbsp;doctrine&nbsp;and doctrinaire may thus be tried. If we&nbsp;gather&nbsp;grapes&nbsp;of them, they are not&nbsp;thorns:&nbsp;if they produce nothing but&nbsp;thistle-down, they are not&nbsp;fig-trees. Some object to this practical method of test; but&nbsp;wise&nbsp;Christians&nbsp;will carry it with them as the ultimate touchstone.</p>
<p>What is the effect of modern theology upon the spirituality, the prayerfulness, the&nbsp;holiness&nbsp;of the people? Has it any good effect?</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.17;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.17" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:17</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%207.18;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 7.18" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18</a>.&nbsp;Even so every good&nbsp;tree&nbsp;bringeth forth good fruit; but a&nbsp;corrupt&nbsp;tree&nbsp;bringeth forth&nbsp;evil&nbsp;fruit.

<p>Every man produces according to his&nbsp;nature; he cannot do otherwise.&nbsp;Good&nbsp;tree, good fruit;&nbsp;corrupt&nbsp;tree,&nbsp;evil&nbsp;fruit.&nbsp;There is no possibility of the effect being higher and better than the cause. The truly good does not bring forth&nbsp;evil; it would be contrary to its&nbsp;nature. The radically bad never rises to produce good, though it may seem to do so. Therefore the one and the other may be known by the special fruit of each. Our King is a great&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;of&nbsp;prudence. We are not to&nbsp;judge; but we are to&nbsp;know,&nbsp;and the rule for this&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;is as simple as it is&nbsp;safe. Such&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;of men may&nbsp;save&nbsp;us from great&nbsp;mischief&nbsp;which would come to us through associating with bad and&nbsp;deceitful&nbsp;persons.</p>

<p>Only let time enough be given, and every man on&nbsp;earth&nbsp;who bears no good fruit will meet his&nbsp;doom. It is not merely the&nbsp;wicked, the bearer of&nbsp;poison&nbsp;berries, that will be&nbsp;cut&nbsp;down; but the neutral, the man who bears no fruit of positive&nbsp;virtue&nbsp;must also be cast into the&nbsp;fire.</p>

<p>Who wants to build his&nbsp;nest&nbsp;upon a&nbsp;tree&nbsp;which is soon to be&nbsp;cut&nbsp;down?</p>

<p>No verbal homage will suffice: “Not every one that saith.&nbsp;” We may believe in our Lord’s&nbsp;Deity, and we may take great pains to&nbsp;affirm&nbsp;it over and over again with our “Lord,&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;”;&nbsp;but unless we carry out the commands of the&nbsp;Father, we pay no true homage to the Son. We may own our obligations to&nbsp;Jesus, and so call him “Lord,&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;”;&nbsp;but if we never practically carry out those obligations, what is the value of our admissions?

<p>An orthodox creed will not&nbsp;save&nbsp;if it stands alone, neither will it be sure to do so if accompanied by official position and service. These people said, “Lord,&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;”;&nbsp;and, in addition, pleaded their prophesying or&nbsp;preaching&nbsp;in his name. All the&nbsp;preaching&nbsp;m the&nbsp;world&nbsp;will not&nbsp;save&nbsp;the&nbsp;preacher&nbsp;if he does not&nbsp;practice. Yes, and he may have been successful, — successful to a very high degree, “are in thy name have cast out&nbsp;devils&nbsp;”,&nbsp;and yet, without personal&nbsp;holiness, the casterout of&nbsp;devils&nbsp;will be cast out himself. The success&nbsp;boasted&nbsp;of may have had about it surprising circumstances of varied interest — “and in thy name done many wonderful works&nbsp;”;&nbsp;and yet the man may be unknown to&nbsp;Christ. Three times over the person is described as doing all “in thy name&nbsp;”;&nbsp;and yet the&nbsp;Lord, whose name he used so freely, so boldly, knew nothing of him, and would not&nbsp;suffer&nbsp;him to remain in his&nbsp;company. The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;endure&nbsp;the presence of those who call him “Lord,&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;”,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;work&nbsp;iniquity. They professed to him that they knew him; but he will “profess unto them, I never knew you.&nbsp;” How solemn is this reminder to me, and to others! Nothing will&nbsp;prove&nbsp;us to be true&nbsp;Christians&nbsp;but a sincere doing of the Father’s will! We may be know by all to have great&nbsp;spiritual&nbsp;power&nbsp;over&nbsp;devils, and men, and yet our&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;may not own us in that great day; but may drive us out as&nbsp;impostors&nbsp;whom he cannot tolerate in his presence.</p>

<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.24;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.24" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:24</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%207.25;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 7.25" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25</a>.&nbsp;Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a&nbsp;wise&nbsp;man, which built his&nbsp;house&nbsp;upon a&nbsp;rock: and the rain descended and the&nbsp;floods&nbsp;came, and the&nbsp;winds&nbsp;blew, and beat upon that&nbsp;house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a&nbsp;rock. -&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are to&nbsp;hear&nbsp;our&nbsp;Lord; and by this is, of course, intended that we are to accept what he says as authoritative: this is more than some do at this time, for they sit in&nbsp;judgment&nbsp;upon the teachings of. the&nbsp;Lord. But hearing is not enough; we must&nbsp;do these sayings.&nbsp;There must be practical&nbsp;godliness, or nothing is right within us. The doing hearer has built a&nbsp;house&nbsp;with a stable&nbsp;foundation: the&nbsp;wisest&nbsp;and safest, but the most expensive and toilsome thing to do.&nbsp;Trials&nbsp;come to him. His&nbsp;sincerity&nbsp;and truthfulness do not prevent his being tested. From above, and from beneath, and from all sides, the&nbsp;trials&nbsp;come: rain,&nbsp;floods&nbsp;and&nbsp;wind.&nbsp;No screen is interposed: all these “beat upon the&nbsp;house.&nbsp;” It is a substantial structure; but the tests become so severe that nothing can&nbsp;save&nbsp;the&nbsp;building&nbsp;unless it be the&nbsp;strength&nbsp;of its&nbsp;foundation. Because the&nbsp;chief&nbsp;support is so immovable the entire erection survives. “It fell not&nbsp;”: it&nbsp;may have&nbsp;suffered&nbsp;damage&nbsp;here and there, and it may have looked very&nbsp;weather-beaten; but “it fell not.&nbsp;” Let the&nbsp;Rock&nbsp;of Ages be&nbsp;praised&nbsp;if, after&nbsp;terrible&nbsp;tribulation, it can be said of our&nbsp;faith, “it fell not: for it was founded upon a&nbsp;rock.&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.26;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.26" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:26</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%207.27;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 7.27" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27</a>.&nbsp;And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his&nbsp;house&nbsp;upon the&nbsp;sand: and the rain descended, and the&nbsp;flood&nbsp;”&nbsp;came, and the&nbsp;winds&nbsp;blew, and beat upon that&nbsp;house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</p>
<p>The mere hearer is in a&nbsp;poor&nbsp;plight. He, too, is a&nbsp;house-builder. The hearing of the Lord’s sayings sets him upon&nbsp;work, and&nbsp;work&nbsp;which is designed to afford him shelter and&nbsp;comfort. He “built his&nbsp;house&nbsp;”:&nbsp;he was practical and persevering, and did not begin and leave off before completion. Yet though he was industrious, he was&nbsp;foolish.&nbsp;No doubt he built quickly, for his&nbsp;foundation&nbsp;cost&nbsp;him no severe&nbsp;labor; his excavations were soon made, for there was no&nbsp;rock&nbsp;to remove: he “built his&nbsp;house&nbsp;upon the&nbsp;sand.&nbsp;” But&nbsp;trials&nbsp;come even to insincere professors. Are we not all&nbsp;born&nbsp;to&nbsp;trouble? The same&nbsp;kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;afflictions&nbsp;come to the foolish as come to the&nbsp;wise, and they operate in precisely the same way; but the result is very different. “It fell.&nbsp;” These are solemn words. It was a fine&nbsp;building, and it&nbsp;promised&nbsp;to stand for ages; but “it fell.&nbsp;” There were minor faults in the fabric, but its&nbsp;chief&nbsp;weakness&nbsp;was underground, in the&nbsp;secret&nbsp;place of the&nbsp;foundation: the man “built his&nbsp;house&nbsp;upon the&nbsp;sand.&nbsp;” His fundamentals were wrong.</p>
<p>The crash was&nbsp;terrible; the sound was heard&nbsp;afar: “great was the fall of it.&nbsp;” The overflow was final and irretrievable. Many heard the fall, and many more saw the ruins as they remained a perpetual&nbsp;memorial&nbsp;of the result of that&nbsp;folly&nbsp;which is satisfied with hearing, and neglects doing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.28;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matt 7.28" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:28</a>, <a class="rtBibleRef" href="https://ref.ly/Matthew%207.29;nasb95?t=biblia" data-reference="Matthew 7.29" data-version="nasb95" data-purpose="bible-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29</a>.&nbsp;And it came to pass, when&nbsp;Jesus&nbsp;had ended these sayings, the people were&nbsp;astonished&nbsp;at his&nbsp;doctrine: for he taught them as one having&nbsp;authority, and not as the&nbsp;scribes.</p>
<p>The sermon is over; what has come of it? Never was there so great a&nbsp;Preacher, and never did he&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;a greater&nbsp;discourse: how many were the penitents? How many the&nbsp;converts? We do not hear of any.&nbsp;Divine&nbsp;truth, even when&nbsp;preached&nbsp;to&nbsp;perfection, will not of itself affect the&nbsp;heart&nbsp;to conversion. The most overpowering&nbsp;authority&nbsp;produces no obedience unless the Holy&nbsp;Ghost&nbsp;subdue&nbsp;the hearer’s&nbsp;heart. “The people were&nbsp;astonished&nbsp;”:&nbsp;was this all? It is to be&nbsp;feared&nbsp;it was. Two things surprised them; the substance of his teaching, and the manner of it.</p>
<p>They had never heard such&nbsp;doctrine&nbsp;before; the&nbsp;precepts&nbsp;which he had given were quite new to their thoughts. But their main astonishment was at his manner: there was a certainly a&nbsp;power, a weight about it, such as they had never seen in the ordinary professional instructors. He did not raise&nbsp;questions, nor speak with hesitation; neither did he cite&nbsp;authorities, and&nbsp;hide&nbsp;his own responsibility behind great names. “He taught them as one having&nbsp;authority.&nbsp;” He spoke royally: the&nbsp;truth&nbsp;itself was its own argument and demonstration. He taught prophetically, as one inspired from above: men felt that he spake after the manner of one sent of&nbsp;God. It was no fault on their part to be&nbsp;astonished,&nbsp;but it was a&nbsp;grave&nbsp;crime&nbsp;to be&nbsp;astonished&nbsp;and nothing more.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;Savior, this was a&nbsp;poor&nbsp;reward&nbsp;for thy right&nbsp;royal&nbsp;discourse&nbsp;— “The people were&nbsp;astonished.&nbsp;” Grant to me that I may not care to&nbsp;astonish&nbsp;people, but may I be enabled to win them for thee: and if, with my utmost endeavors. I do&nbsp;astonish&nbsp;them, and nothing more, may I never complain; for how should the&nbsp;disciple&nbsp;be above his&nbsp;Lord?</p>

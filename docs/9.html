            <p>They are not only passively peaceful, like the meek, who keep the peace; but actively peaceful by endeavoring to end wars and contentions, and so make peace. These not only are the children of the peace-loving God, but they come to be called so; for men are struck by their likeness to their Father. Hereby is our sonship known to ourselves and others. Men of peace are the children of the God of peace, and their Father's blessing rests on them.
This seventh beatitude is a very high and glorious one; let us all endeavor to obtain it. Never let us be peacebreakers; evermore let us be peacemakers Yet must we not cry "peace, peace, where there is no peace."
The verse before, this speaks of purity, and this of peace. First pure, then peaceable: this is God's order, and it should be ours.</p><p>- C.H. Spurgeon, <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/matthew-5-commentary-spurgeon">Matthew 5 Commentary</a></p>

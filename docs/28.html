            <p>In this case our King again sets aside the glosses of men upon the commands of God, and makes the law to be seen in its vast spiritual breadth. Whereas tradition had confined the prohibition to an overt act of unchastity, the King shows that it forbade the unclean desires of the heart.</p>
<p>Here the divine law is shown to refer, not only to the act of criminal conversation, but even to the desire, imagination, or passion which would suggest such an infamy. What a King is ours, who stretches his scepter over the realm of our inward lusts! How sovereignly he puts it: "But I say unto you"! Who but a divine being has authority to speak in this fashion?</p>
<p>His word is law. So it ought to be, seeing he touches vice at the fountain-head, and forbids uncleanness in the heart. If sin were not allowed in the mind, it would never be made manifest in the body: this, therefore, is a very effectual way of dealing with the em. But how searching, how condemning! Irregular looks, unchaste desires, and strong passions are of the very essence of adultery; and who can claim a lifelong freedom from them? Yet these are the things which defile a man. Lord, purge them out of my nature, and make me pure within.</p><p>- C.H. Spurgeon, <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/matthew-5-commentary-spurgeon">Matthew 5 Commentary</a></p>

        <h3>The Whole Sermon So Far</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>Matthew 5:1-28 (new text today in bold)</summary>
            <div id="reference-text-whole">
                <p>Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' <strong>But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</strong></p>

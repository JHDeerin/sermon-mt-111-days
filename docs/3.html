            <p>The King's first statutes are Benedictions. He begins his teaching with a largess of blessings. The Old Testament ended with "a curse": the New Testament opens with "Blessed." This word is by some rendered "happy"; but we like blessed best. Our Lord brings to men true Beatitudes by his teaching, and by his kingdom.</p>
<p>Spiritual poverty is both commanded and commended. It is the basis of Christian experience. No one begins aright who has not felt poverty of spirit. Yet even to this first sign of grace is the kingdom given in present possession: "theirs is the kingdom of heaven ." The question in heaven's kingdom is not, "Are you a peer?" but, "Are you poor in spirit?" Those who are of no account in their own eyes are of the blood royal of the universe. These alone have the principles and the qualifications for heavenly kingdom. May I be such!</p><p>- C.H. Spurgeon, <a href="https://www.preceptaustin.org/matthew-5-commentary-spurgeon">Matthew 5 Commentary</a></p>
